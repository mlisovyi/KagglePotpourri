This is important as for a local model evaluation we need to use a split, that will create a validation sample with composition close to our test/submission sample. \n\nAs is demonstrated with a basic EDA in https://www.kaggle.com/mlisovyi/featureengineering-basic-model, `Elevation` is correlated to the target class and at the same time its profile is very different between train and test samples. So we can expect that the class composition differs a lot between the two samples.\n\nThe kernel simply creates 7 files each having a fixed label prediction from 1 to 7. One can submit these files and the fraction of corresponding classes will be equal to the returned score.\n\nWith this exercise, it was estimated, that the proportion of classes in the test sample is  `0.37053 : 0.49681 : 0.05936 : 0.00103 : 0.01295 : 0.02687 : 0.03242`. So ideally one would create a validation sample that would hold the same mixture."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in \n\nimport numpy as np # linear algebra\nimport pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)\n\n# Input data files are available in the \"../input/\" directory.\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory\n\nimport os\nprint(os.listdir(\"../input\"))\n\n# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"sub = pd.read_csv('../input/sample_submission.csv')","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"df09e3fd808eadf8ad2a0c4ff180055d9e6a40d8"},"cell_type":"code","source":"for i in range(1,8):\n    print(i)\n    sub['Cover_Type'] = i\n    sub.to_csv('submission_{}.csv'.format(i), index=False)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"f8016af7cd6b6b3e8e0b9c54acdab0fcab629de2"},"cell_type":"code","source":"!ls","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_uuid":"5e38a26cc3b4f51bc7d5a43675faa3a57d8a367d"},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.6","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
